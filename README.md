# image-compression
The objective of this project is to explore and apply techniques for lossless and lossy compression like singular value decomposition (SVD) and discrete cosine transform (DCT). 

Further, the compression ratios of both methods were compared, coming to a conclusion that DCT performed better than SVD.
